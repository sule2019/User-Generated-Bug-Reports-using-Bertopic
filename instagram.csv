Harsh Deol,"March 2, 2023","The number of new bugs with each update is atrocious. The reels randomly stop playing. When I rewatch a reel, only the audio plays and the video is stuck at the thumbnail. The note feature has been disabled for one of my accounts. What sorcery is happening in the direct messages? The camera icon in front of each chat is placed at different places depending on how long the lastupdate text is and it just looks.

Karthik B,"March 3, 2023","It is an excellent app overall. The meta team is working hard and the results can be seen here. I just have a small suggestion. If possible could you add a search function for saved reels/posts when saving to a collection cus it's honesty a pain to scroll through a lot of folder names when you are trying to be organised and making sure that the reels you save are actually helpful when required. An amazing app, thank you","7,177 people found this review helpful",5,instagram

Devapriya Renjith Mampalathu,"February 11, 2023","So many glitches. Like so many!!! App closing by itself. Resizing the picture all by itself before posting. Worst one, reels and videos always getting stuck and slowed where the song moves right ahead. The video follows the song which is in its original speed like the old tv shows with broken movements. Can't believe such an internationally used app has these many flaws. Uninstalled it many times.","22,011 people found this review helpful",1,instagram

Akash Tibriwal,"January 17, 2023","Even after reporting a bug twice, the problem was not solved. Now, I can't even report. A notification pops up saying - ""the bug report failed to upload"".

There's no autosave of videos that I am creating.","9,142 people found this review helpful",2,instagram

Even after precisely ""Not Interesting"" a type of content multiple times, the Algorithm doesn't compute it. And the Fake accounts and Scam advertisements are running Rampant without any issues.

Divya Bahal,"February 27, 2023",There is a persisting issue faced by me on Instagram since the last few days where I am not getting access to reels. The tab which used to appear on the lower right corner has disappeared and the reels feature is completely disabled on my account. Neither does my search area shows any reels. Instead of reinstalling and logging in repeatedly the issue is unresolved. I had already reported the issue twice but didn't recieve any response from Instagram.

Kharad Variyava,"February 9, 2023","When scrolling through accounts with ~2K+ images, the app considerably slows down the device, especially after scrolling ~the first 1K images; so much so, that you have to kill the app & occasionally restart the device. Have seen this issue reported many times in the past by other users, but considering the issue yet persists, the developers have not done anything in this regard. Also, its high time, that you guys allow/introduce editing of the comments, rather than delete and re-type it.","4,428 people found this review helpful",3,instagram

Bala Murugan.J,"March 4, 2023",My reels button is missing since a few weeks now. Even after reporting the problem it's not resolved. I preferred using Instagram over other apps for reels and it's gone. What's the point of the app now? I can't see nor share reels. And tha search feed doesn't refresh at all.

Saurabh Ghosh,"January 17, 2023","All good except some really stupid flaws. Why doesn't Instagram auto detect the location from the location data embedded in the photos? One of the biggest annoyances are spam comments, especially those asking to invest in crypto. It's absolutely ridiculous. Also why can't I see sensitive content if I want to! And it doesn't allow selecting files from Google Photos & Files app. That's a serious headache. Also, why not allow links to be clicked??! Shows ""video cannot be posted"". What's the reason?","12,389 people found this review helpful",1,instagram
Giray Arat,"February 27, 2023","Editing videos is really hard. The app freezes, doesn't work most of the time. And there are no alternatives. You are not allowed to upload on the browser. A lot of things happen without you getting notified about them beforehand. There are settings for media upload quality, everyone!! Look at those before you post. IG will not post your photos at their original quality, otherwise. For a system that solely focuses on media, it's interesting how troublesome the bare-bones system can be.","1,491 people found this review helpful",2,instagram

Elle Gentry,"February 26, 2023","Each of my accounts on one device has a different layout. One has no reels at all; none in the discovery, and I can't scroll through reels on a page, I have to click them individually. I'm sure this is a test but I'm not a fan. I do like that the reels portal was moved from the middle of the bottom bar, it has kept me from jumping right into scrolling when I log on. But I would like to be able to navigate reels on pages easier and have them come up on my discovery.","1,896 people found this review helpful",3,instagram

Usually I have to uninstall/reinstall the app for them to show up, otherwise it's days before I can actually see them. Also, if there was a way for the pictures one day to not be cut off when posting that'd be awesome. I use a whole separate app and put a frame around some pictures cause Instagram zooms in so much.

Nolan Petersen,"February 17, 2023","This app gets worse and worse. First I couldn't use the tilt shift, which stopped working over a year ago and hasn't been fixed despite multiple reports. Then I had issues when I tried to edit multiple photos on a single post -- each photo would revert to its original dimensions when I tried to adjust one of the other photos. Add onto that the incessant ads, the pushing for video content and reels, and the fixation on competition with TikTok, and frankly it is no wonder I use this app less.",995 people found this review helpful,2,instagram

Lily Rose,"February 27, 2023","Instagram just keeps getting worse with every update. When making reels, the words are stretched, and you have to retype the words 1 or more times. the audio doesn't sync up, when you download one of YOUR videos it barely ever downloads with the audio.

Aaron Baker,"March 1, 2023","Stories are broken again; it seems like every other update and always in a new way. This time - when sharing a post to my story, tapping the picture doesn't show a preview of the post's caption. The picture just bounces but does nothing. Also, when posting a story, I used to be able to press and hold the ""post to story"" option and select a highlight to add to as soon as it posted. Now it just tries to share the story to FB, but I have to go watch my own story and add to a highlight from there.","1,035 people found this review helpful",2,instagram

Because of this, the filters are also affected hence my photos are in low quality. Please fix it! It's annoying and this has been happening many times now.

Lindsay Hardy,"March 2, 2023","Just discovered I'm not the only one with this issue.... mid selections, or photo editing, the app just resizes the photos, or corrupts a photo, or voids the edits. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes to edit... and all of it just goes away. Videos don't appear. Stories after posting, won't exit and I have to ""discard"".

Marie,"March 4, 2023","For months I've been unable to edit multi-photo posts. It does not save the position of the photos. When I edit the photo and click save, the photo shifts over, causing it to be oddly cropped and creating a large white space on one side. What's the deal? Why are you unable to fix this? I've submitted this issue multiple times. I know I'm one of many people experiencing this issue. Very frustrating. This issue limits what I can post.",114 people found this review helpful,1,instagram
Daniel McGown,"February 27, 2023","Twice in the last month, Instagram has disabled my account with threat of permanent disablement within 30 days with no explanation. To re-enable the account, you have to go through a mysterious black box process, and if it fails, you lose access to all of your photos forever with no recourse. If you use this app, back up your images to another service or you could lose everything for no discernible reason with no warning.",216 people found this review helpful,1,instagram
Lee Stahler,"March 3, 2023","The app has become frustrating to use. The layout changes have caused a lot of time waste and annoyance.

Stella Starstruck,"March 2, 2023","Please make a new update, because instagram literally is mostly unusable right now. Every time I try to upload a photo or group of photos, instagram glitches me out and deletes every edit or the pictures I selected right before I post. The reels are super glitchy if you try to make one, its terrible all around. And if you try to make a story and type, it freezes up and force-crashes.

Kaitlyn Z,"February 28, 2023","In general, it's a good app, however it seems that there are frequent 'micro-updates'- not to the installed software, but to its overall functionality- even without being opted into the beta version. This can result in a frustrating user experience, as you end up either dealing with bugs, or unannounced changes to the UI simply befuddle you until you figure out the changes for yourself.

Know or Guess,"March 2, 2023","Th ärey have everything. The app and its progress has been a smart idea. The only thing that gets me really annoyed is that they force you to scroll through too many sponsored videos on the home part of the app. It's a completely ok and 4 to implicate but there's a limit to the acceptable amount of it and according to me and many others for that matter, they passed that limit way long ago. Very unnecessary to exaggerate that much in that front. Otherwise good job 👍🏼",37 people found this review helpful,4,instagram

Kenneth Crader,"February 18, 2023","The app itself is fine, however I'm not a fan of what's been done to the explore page. Instead of giving me the option to scroll through things I actually want to see, you force me to look at categories that have nothing to do with my personal interests. It'll switch from explore to motorcycles, to tattoos, to explore, to food, to outfit inspiration. Should have kept the explore tab the way it was instead of the garbage you force down my throat with this update.","1,104 people found this review helpful",2,instagram
Julia Stuckenberg,"March 2, 2023","There isn't an option to remove the description when I share a post through my story anymore. Also, It's STILL doing the same as my last couple reviews: When I open the app, it will show me the most recent post in my feed for half a second and then disappear. Most times I'm unable to find it again unless I search their profile. Edit: Now the post disappears when I swipe to see the next photo in the post. So frustrating!!!!!!!!",268 people found this review helpful,1,instagram

When using square frames, IG tends to screw this up and on one side of the picture, there is an ugly white bar.

Kate Rodriguez,"February 6, 2023","Instagram has a serious issue with loading photos without distorting them. I even close out and reopen the app and it rarely looks the way I want. I always have to wait a few days and then try and upload a picture that fits the screen. I believe it's an android/instagram hate relationship. Dont punish me for owning an android. Also, when choosing a cover frame for my reels, it distorts those as well. The green screen has gone away for now, but then another bug has emerged.",388 people found this review helpful,2,instagram
H W,"January 4, 2023","I value the community aspect of this app but I'm suffering from silly little bugs constantly. I have sent multiple bug reports via the app that have not really been addressed. Editing multiple images is a problem, the images can sometimes get distorted so much I don't bother with the post. Centering an image in the edit section just doesn't work on my phone and when the photo is uploaded it's in a different position. Adverts are obtrusive and take away from the experience.",304 people found this review helpful,2,instagram

But theres no way to see what you reported or the status on it. There is no true customer service for these issues atm which is very upsetting. No email. No chat. Nothing. Very frustrating. especially when i see message notifications and can see none of them. Update:Spent over 4month w glitchy dm. No help. no access to new notes feature.,16 people found this review helpful,1,instagram
Lolla Kolbe,"January 9, 2023","Instagram is getting more and more frustrating by the day. Over the years the simple act of posting 10 photos has become near impossible without a bug. Either it glitches out and loses all my edits or it forgets edits done to a few of the photos. Recently I have been unable to make any multiple-photo posts without the alignment of the photos completely f*ing out. The app keeps throwing a portion of my photo off screen, with a huge black or white frame on the left or right and no way to fix it.",664 people found this review helpful,2,instagram
Parneet Brar,"February 10, 2023","Like it but I don't So I got instagram in 2020 cause my mom didn't let me get tik tok. It's addicting to watch but making reels is kinda off. First of all I want better fonts, the fonts on Instagram are a little cringe and boring. Next can u make it better on androids? If I do to many clips it lags out turns my reel off and deletes it. If my clip is ""to long"" it won't let me put text there which is extremely frustrating. Overall I like the app but If you could fix these bugs I'd love it more.",16 people found this review helpful,3,instagram

rat king,"February 2, 2023","This app is just picking and choosing which bugs you can live with to have actually working features. My replies haven't been working for weeks now, and now there's a new feature called ""roll call"" getting in the way of my stickers tab. Half of the time changing colors in drawing doesn't work. I can uninstall and reinstall to fix it, but then my chat themes probably wouldn't work, I wouldn't be able to like comments, or some other bugs yet to be found.",822 people found this review helpful,1,instagram

Hailey Rasmussen,"February 11, 2023","What the hell is going on with this app? Instagram used to be working so well with subtle updates and fixing areas. Now it's just acting up. Posting videos on my story GLITCHES it out and I've done everything to see if it'll make a difference but it doesn't. The themes get mucked up and when I tab out then back in, it's half dark and half light. The dm themes sometimes just go completely black and it won't even notify me that I've received a message from anyone.

Pixxlated,"March 2, 2023","Fix the notifs. Whenever you lock your phone while Instagram is still pulled up, or you switch apps without fully closing Instagram, it's a total dice-roll as to whether or not you'll actually receive a notification. Sometimes it even marks DMs as ""read"" if you lock your phone while on someone's DMs. It causes a lot of miscommunication and problems.

Every time a video finishes it automatically slides down to the next one regardless of whether I'm finished watching.

Vincent Felix,"February 3, 2023","Instagram is super broken rn. Had a problem with posting photos, where if I had multiple it would distort them all and crop them funny. Thinking it was buggy I decided to Uninstall and reinstall the app. When I opened it back up I noticed it looked different. I just realized it's a super old build. I don't have the reel tab anymore and my notifications tab is back on the bottom (hasn't been there for years if I remember correctly) something is super broken.

When I click on external links, the whole page glitches when I come back to Instagram so I have to close and open. This has been happening for years even when I uninstall and reinstall. Hate that I can't change my name more than 2x in 2 weeks, especially when I'm trying to experiment with emojis and fonts.

That has appeared 2-3 times since then, and each time increases. It has taken me 3 and 21 hours to get my DMS back the last two times that has happened.

Photos with captions are more engaging than those with no captions. So, you do need to use them. But, it can be quite confusing when writing a caption.

Disabled everything unwanted, the app somehow finds new unnecessary thing to push as notification. This is so frustrating. Who cares about ""New popular reels in your area?"". And that only one of many silly ones.

The language option in the app is useless, everything is still in English by default even after changing it to French or Spanish. False positive notification indicators making the app more miserable than it already is. Website is more thrash.. new unread messages/ notification labeled but nothing actually visible. Activity notification from past 2-3 months coming up now all of them repetitive.",62 people found this review helpful,1,instagram

Tried contacting the developer with no answer.","2,723 people found this review helpful",3,instagram
Krista Carroll,"November 7, 2022","I used to love this app and it has always been my favorite, but of late it's become ""buggy"" and has glitches. I've cleared the caches, uninstalled and reinstalled 3 times. It gets better for a about an hour and then starts to close unexpectedly along with freezing up. I can't see some reels because of lines going across the video screen. My tablet is brand new too, so I don't know what else to do. I wished they get it fixed. Thinking of going to Tik Tok if it doesn't get worked out soon.","5,481 people found this review helpful",1,instagram
Morgan Gosnell,"November 15, 2022","Glitches. All. The. Time. It will close down, for like no reason. Half of the time I save an audio, it doesn't save. I supposedly have a professional account but I don't have the little ""+"" for transitions. That's a bummer. I'd like to made better reels. Also, I wish there was a little check mark next to audio you've already used. It got confusing around Halloween. I imagine Christmas will be the same.

Sarah Essid,"September 20, 2022","Overall, it's pretty great. But a bit after the pandemic began to cease, it's been getting worse and worse. My map0p problem comes with making new accounts, if you already have an account on your phone, it's nearly impossible to add another. I used to have 3 accounts and they all worked perfectly fine. But once I tried 4o change one, it force stopped all my accounts. Over only the past 3 years, I might have had almost 8 accounts because of this recurring problem. Pls fix it.","2,164 people found this review helpful",1,instagram
Daniel Sullivan,"October 1, 2022",The app is broken. It has issues uploading posts. It bugs out a lot. The devs can't seem to make up their mind on how the UI should look and will sometimes change it more than once within a day. It's also filled with 30yr old women who peaked in high school trying to get attention by lip syncing audio clips and providing nothing of value. All of my friends have become jaded with the app and are leaving one by one. The algorithms don't show anything that I would actually enjoy seeing.,865 people found this review helpful,2,instagram
Matt Sauve,"September 22, 2022","One of the worst apps for creating content. There is a minefield of bugs you need to avoid when trying to create a post whether that be a photo or reel. Drafts can get lost completely, captions disappear from drafts for many reasons, audio and video changes in a draft may not get saved, music from the music library turns to static, and the thumbnail picker doesnt load. For being such a popular app, instagram has the worst interface and fails to perform its core functions without major hassle.",269 people found this review helpful,1,instagram
Aidan D.,"September 17, 2022","Newest update is awful. If I see a ""sensitive content warning"" no matter how many times I click ""see video"" the content warning comes back up after 2 or 3 seconds.

All this started happening after I updated the app a week ago.",749 people found this review helpful,1,instagram
Noah Lepek,"October 25, 2022","Overall, the app is very easy to use, and it is a great way to communicate with others. I do believe it is the best social media platform.

Really don't need recommendations; definitely keep the feature but have the ability to hide them.","3,162 people found this review helpful",5,instagram

Ive been using this app for 5 years and never had any problems till the past year or two. Constantly uodating the app but nothing fixes the issues. Focus on the problems.

Rob Blaich,"September 17, 2022","Instagram used to be a straight forward app. Post a photo, and carry on.

Cara Bevan Art,"November 14, 2022","It's a decent, if a little annoying, app. The ads are abundant it recommends alot of pages instead of showing who you follow often. I don't like how it's trying to follow TikTok's trend of encouraging (and bribing!) users to upload reels. Saying that, it's still a good place to upload art and images and use it as a gallery or reference point. It's pretty easy to use and a simple format.

marie davis,"October 31, 2022","Very frustrating that there are so many bugs. Makes running a business on here infuriating. Can't edit posts, text on reels is so unpredictable and changes format once a reel is posted. They can take hours to make and then you have to do it all over again.

I love reels and the concept but every time I try posting a reel either insta messes up the text to a different font or it's the font I picked but looks like it was squished and not the placement I had it.

Chris Weaver,"November 20, 2022","Pathetic. Development of this app gets worse and worse. So many bugs, so many forced shopping tools, interface changes, bloat, etc. On top of all that the algorithm means only a tiny fraction of your audience sees your posts and vice versa. For a social media app, they've lost their way, and have simply allowed room for someone to do it better and take their business. Used to be about photography and sharing. It is anything but nowadays. I don't know anyone anywhere that thinks it isn't worse.",475 people found this review helpful,1,instagram

R,"October 31, 2022","Instagrams functionality gets worse and worse every single time they add a new feature to reels. It's clear to EVERYONE using the platform that it's for nothing but the monetisation of influencer accounts, and that it's getting closer to TikTok, without TikToks video editing benefits. The functionality of insta needs to be optimised before adding new things to it. For example, almost every time I make a reel, it freezes half way through the edit, insta shuts down, and my work is lost. Not a fan",249 people found this review helpful,1,instagram

If I go to a profile's reels and play a video, all the other reel posts on that profile will play the original video I watched. Also, editing reels takes up a lot of memory. If you don't have a really good phone, it just takes absolutely forever to make a reel.

Cammi Schoenherr,"October 9, 2022","The video chat feature just got obliterated in the most recent update, if both cameras turn off it turns down the audio volume so low there's no way to hear it. It even does this when connected to headphones, and if you try to turn it onto speaker to be able to hear it will disconnect from headphones and go back to using the phone speaker, and still be too quiet to hear. Just revert it! Also, they swapped where you and the other person are (you used to be the top and now you're on bottom) Why?!",163 people found this review helpful,1,instagram

Carol Opara,"February 21, 2023",I hate Instagram algorithms because it makes it hard for people to see your content especially if you're growing your content Organically. 🤷‍♀️ I have used Instagram for 6 years now and never seen much growth unlike TikTok I grew my account last to having 60k followers on the platform. 🤷‍♀️ Instagram has to fix their algorithms and make it easy for people to share their content and for their content to be seen by other people. People who use bots grow theirs faster.🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️ Reels is no bueno,0,3,instagram

Insta wants us to make more reels but I've just made one twice now and it's uploaded completely different to what was saved with formatting unreadable so a complete waste of time. I'm shocked at how buggy it is for such a mega platform. Please make it better. I like Instagram please don't ruin the experience. Update: Just reinstalled it and reels are entirely missing!

Posting to feed is next to impossible—edits don't show, and adding more than one photo results in glitched duplicates. Reels desync your audio once you hit ""post"", even though they're fine in the preview. Building a reel also causes constant crashes.

Michelle Glauser,"October 31, 2022","Unless you remember the handle or hashtag used, it's nearly impossible to find a post you saw with the terrible search. Also, the process to make reels is so confusing (like what are the dots on the line when selecting audio and why can some people use some audio but not everyone can and why does it freeze a lot right after you've selected audio?). And what is the point of stories being temporary? And why can't you speed up videos or turn on captions?",83 people found this review helpful,3,instagram
