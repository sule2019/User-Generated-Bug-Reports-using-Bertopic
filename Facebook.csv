RO√üIN TUDU,"December 22, 2022","After the update on 11/23/22, I experienced buffering on this app. Many videos just buffer and or comments will not appear and just flash a empty box!! While playing a video, it will stop and begin buffering and either play after a while or just stop!! I'm over it and ready to delete the account!! This has happened with many updates but this is the first time I've said something!! MRKZ!! Good luck!!","57,702 people found this review helpful",4,facebook
Dale Poston,"March 5, 2023",The last couple of updates on this app have really brought the quality down. I own a business. My primary source of advertisement is Facebook business. I can still manage most things. But the thing I need the most I can't access anymore. And that would be my notifications on my business page. It won't pull up any notifications not even if I try to refresh the page. Facebook needs to get this fixed quickly because you are affecting a lot of small businesses in a very negative way,"3,823 people found this review helpful",1,facebook
MidnightStar Sparks,"March 1, 2023","This app used to be great, but now it's just become more and more unstable. Notifications don't appear until you refresh the tab, auto-play for videos keeps turning back on, which I personally hate because it pauses my music, and ads are out of control. I could list more, but it would take more than the maximum word limit. Just stick to facebook on your browser. It works a whole lot better than this junk app.","9,633 people found this review helpful",2,facebook
FryingRonald,"February 21, 2023","Facebook is a cool app to share posts and media to a bunch of friends. However, I've been running into this problem where reels is definitely broken. Oftentimes, (In great frequency) the reels is muted and you'll have to pause and play the videos (same goes for the video player) and when opening the comments for the second time in the reels, the comment window won't load even when relaunching the same reel. This is a bug that is damaging the user experience that's why I only gave 4 stars.","14,835 people found this review helpful",4,facebook
marychel viray,"February 14, 2023","The video stretches to full screen when editing it to add to story so you have no idea how you can edit it correctly. There are times when previous comments are not visible and you have to wait for it to load. After switching accounts, the account logs out automatically. I often get locked out of my account even though the account has complete backup/secondary email address and phone number. I think they are bugs. Please fix them asap.","12,512 people found this review helpful",1,facebook
Travis Harley,"March 3, 2023","Within the first 10 seconds of using app trying to see if I even like it there was a video ad that was equal to the amount of time I had been playing with the app. Not the best start... ** additional review: when I went back to the app immediately after writing my initial review, the ad was playing again after it already played.

Brenda Zamora,"February 12, 2023","This app continues to fail. Music from this app plays out of my phone even after I close the app. Many times I have to turn off my phone to be able to stop the music. When trying to delete a post- the post does not disappear. I have to go to trash to confirm deletion and then enter my password in order to verify it's me. And then, many times the post is still there! Also, many times I get the same AD over and over despite clicking on ""hide ad"" or ""show less"". It's a very frustrating system.","3,214 people found this review helpful",1,facebook
John Harris,"March 2, 2023","Yall keep flooding my feed with ads and pages I dont even follow and it's really annoying that I can't get the pages off my feed. On top of that, video and reel comments are completely unviewable for some reason and it's been this way for a few weeks now. Facebook has been going downhill like crazy lately and it seems like there's no fixes or updates for it. 1 star because my tickets get ignored as well, no matter how many times I submit a ticket I never get a reply or any help to fix the issue.",171 people found this review helpful,1,facebook
Kyle Gent,"February 25, 2023","There are so many flaws. Mostly with videos. Won't load comments 90% of the time so you're forced to look it up in an external app. Videos are stretched so far leaving you unable start it from the beginning. So you will always miss the first few seconds of any video, with no way of returning to the start properly. On desktop they made it even worse with it popping into a new window anytime you want to view comments, then puts them below so you can't see the video. Every update seems to be worse",623 people found this review helpful,1,facebook
Robert Grimm,"February 16, 2023","Notifications don't always go to the content they're about. What really drove the rating down to one star was it no longer opening things outside the app without going out of your way to do it. Links should open in the browser. YouTube should open in the YouTube app. This should be default behavior. It isn't even an option anymore. You have to do it manually every time, if it will even open the link at all. It often fails that, forcing a restart and losing the link.","2,480 people found this review helpful",1,facebook

claripossum,"February 10, 2023","The functionality of this app is nothing less than frustrating. The auto refresh interrupts articles that I'm reading because even though I set it to open everything in a browser, it still opens within the app half the time. And if I switch to a different app and come back to Facebook, it auto refreshed then too and I've lost my spot. And I can almost never find replies to my comments on reels. Just garbage.","6,501 people found this review helpful",2,facebook
Jordan Darthard,"February 22, 2023",Good app. But lately I have noticed there's a glitch or something whenever I want to try and watch a reel video or any videos on Facebook. It doesn't let me watch them when I click on them. Please fix this issue with another update. It's becoming frustrating using the app lately. My phone is totally fine. Everything else works.

Chef Cara,"March 2, 2023","I can't click on a video from my timeline anymore. I have to go to the actual page and scroll until I can find the video and then it will work. Also, reels posted in group pages show up on my feed with the person's name but without any explanation where the video came from until I hide it and it will say it was from a certain group's page.

Heavenly Bien,"February 9, 2023","It may appear demanding, but I believe it is preferable if there is a feature that allows me to move specific posts to the album I created. Especially when I have posts from years ago that I want to move for easy access.

Steve L,"February 17, 2023","After each update thing gets worse. After the most recent update, there are issues. It gives notification that a friend mentioned me in a comment on their post, but when clicking the notification, it takes me to the reels/ video feed and not the comment. Seems like the upgrade is focused more on adding videos to newsfeed or directing you to videos with ads rather than improving the experience of using the app. When you report an issue in the app no one gets back to you and it doesn't get fixed.","1,422 people found this review helpful",1,facebook

Mark Buckton,"January 14, 2023",Up until the most recent update it seemed to work fairly well for the most part. Now every time I open the app it almost immediately crashes and needs to be closed. After restarting it seems to be okay again. This is now a regular event though and very annoying. Especially if you see something of interest just before the crash which is no longer there and impossible to find after. ‚òπÔ∏è,"31,295 people found this review helpful",2,facebook
Patrick Thomas,"February 1, 2023","Thought it was just my phone having issues, but I see that more people are experiencing the same issues. The way the pages won't load when trying to read comments made me think it's my internet connection or WIFI, but it's not. When I try to like a post, the options to select an emoji goes away, and I have to click on them a second time. This is frustrating because I worry that I'm going to select the wrong emotion when this happens. Facebook, you can do better.","28,739 people found this review helpful",1,facebook

Rui F Ribeiro,"March 3, 2023","The ratio info/noise is off putting. Reels should have a separate feed, especially with the limited screen size of mobile platforms.

This was a huge reason I watch them on fb versus Instagram which I can at least mute. Also when a video is posted in a comment section there is no option to pause/play or see the length of the video, etc which is really annoying if you miss a part.

If you're going to update; fix bugs and things that aren't working properly, don't take away things we like!!! Fix the bug that when you upload a good quality video, it completely strips the quality. Fix whatever happened to being able to choose a different column/grid layout for a post with multiple pics. Fix the profile layout to bring it back to centered because it's driving all of us OCD people nuts.",329 people found this review helpful,1,facebook

Other than going on your own web browser to log on to FB, the app is just a lesser of two evils due to uploading maneuverability.

Other social media sites are a lot better so I doubt I'll keep using this one much if at all. Too bad since I use to enjoy FB.",6 people found this review helpful,1,facebook

C,"January 29, 2023",See more ads than friends posts. Could be a case that friends don't use Facebook that much as there having same issue in seeing nothing but ads every other post. Also forcing us to have 'most relevant' in comment sections so we have to constantly click 'all comments' is very frustrating!!!! We desperately need a new social media platform that listens to its users and not just about the money. Facebook sinking like the Titanic,162 people found this review helpful,1,facebook

Hides posts from friends but shows posts from groups or people I dont even know that don't allow interaction or comments, pointless! Facebook tracks your offline activity! unless you disable it.

Ge-ar Estroso,"November 11, 2022",I updated my facebook app to enjoy its new features wich is converting my account into a professional account but it was not. Even its updated it was lack of features especially the professional account. It was a disappointment. One thing more Facebook. It was an irritation seeing all videos with ads. Can you please limit the ads? Its okay to see ads but then with moderation and limitation. It was really a disappoinment since the app was updated. Thank You.

But then after that 15 seconds it gives another ad which is kind of frustrating. And then after 10-15 seconds here comes another ad.

This is depressing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Stop forcing your browser so you can track me, it breaks EVERY app link, even iPhones have the same proble, when I open any link that has an app, even Instagram, it opens in your browser, which I have to press Open in Browser so it actually goes go the Instagram app, most of the time it doesn't work. Stop tracking! It even breaks Facebook links.","2,207 people found this review helpful",1,facebook
Keffie,"December 6, 2022","It's Facebook, and that's fine with all its goodies. What I do not like is the support options. It's difficult to explain some issues as the support page won't get additional information, I have been overtaken, I can't get anyone to respond or even acknowledge the major upset it causes. My pages have been tampered with, credentials abused and I am ignored when I explain it. It's not a frivolous hack. It is abuse of my rights. And it is much more than a device or 2. It's widespread.",53 people found this review helpful,3,facebook

Makes it feel pointless to go on here when so little of it is actually posts from my friends. The worst part is you can't turn off ""suggested posts"" and content - it's clearly what Facebook wants us looking at, and our hand is practically forced to do so. I viscerally feel like the product, rather than a user.",33 people found this review helpful,2,facebook

yes,"November 3, 2022","in overall it's a good app, but i will give 3 stars because of this thing i have to wait 60 days to change my name its really annoying and all. i just realized i didnt like that i put my nickname in it and wanted to change it back to my full name and i cant because of your unnecessary rule, you could lower the limit to 30 days and not 60, its really unnecessary and annoying im going to stop using this app again since i cant have my correct name in my account",6 people found this review helpful,3,facebook

Nine 90,"January 28, 2023",A media platform that censors speech. Force feeds you garbage pages/videos/posts instead of just letting you see things from your friends. They're trying so hard that it makes it absolutely the worst experience ever. #BringBackMySpace,2 people found this review helpful,1,facebook
Christopher Pearson,"November 2, 2022",The marketplace is poorly designed I would actually like to view listings in my local area. It also has intrusive ads and I swear it listens to me constantly! I don't agree with the terms of service either. I will be uninstalling as this app depletes battery very quickly and is memory and CPU hungry. It degrades the performance of your phone overall and shortens its lifespan. There is better social media apps than this.,7 people found this review helpful,1,facebook
Irene Hixson,"December 16, 2022",I have alot of friends on Facebook that I really don't know and I don't talk to them but Facebook chooses whoever it wants for confirmation of who I am. Pluses if I'm able to log into my Gmail account and provide a code or log into messages with biometrics you should take that as confirmation.,1 person found this review helpful,2,facebook

Rana Mondal,"October 31, 2022","Dear Facebook Team, Your security system by mistake block my comment option. If i comment anyone, I can't comment them. It is much more important for a Facebook user to use it. The problem is you can't use comment at the moment. Please check it and solve this problem as soon as possible. Thanks Facebook Team.",80 people found this review helpful,5,facebook

Victor S,"December 11, 2022",Facebook doesn't care about its users. There is ZERO customer service. I no longer have my phone number registered with facebook. It says send code to email. After I put in the code it asks to confirm identity with another method and the only option is to send to my phone number which I no longer have.
